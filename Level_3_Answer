You fork a repository to have a copy of the code in your 
local working directories and repository so you are able to
edit the files and code as needed and make local modifications, changes or updates

You achieve this by finding the repository link in github, such as
https://github.com/meenanatarajan/Git-Game.git
and then clicking the "fork" button on the top right
